Applied physicist working on the operations and readout software development of the [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern/) IBL and pixel detectors as a CERN senior applied fellow. Over 5 years experience in silicon pixel detector construction, commissioning and operation. Earned PhD working on the construction, commissioning and performance measurements of the [ALICE](https://alice-collaboration.web.cern.ch/) ITS2.

## Professional Experience

---

Jul 2022 - present
:   **Senior Applied Fellow (Detector Operations)**\
    *[CERN](https://home.cern/) - Geneva, CH*
    - **Positions held:** Pixel Deputy Run Coordinator (Apr 2023 - Oct 2023)\
    - Responsible for the operation and DAQ development of the ATLAS [pixel and IBL detectors](https://atlas.cern/Discover/Detector/Inner-Detector), maximising acquisition of quality data from the 24/7 LHC running schedule by minimising dead time to below 0.1%.
    - On-call detector expert
    - Designed a software package to increase the flexibility of the DAQ software and increase the speed with which detector experts can react to problems.
    - Created a tool to monitor detector parameters over time, prompting systematic re-tunes and aiding the debugging process of problematic modules.
    - Debugged and fixed detector modules with electrical, software, configuration or radiation-damaged-induced problems

Oct 2017 - Jul 2022
:   **PhD in Physics**\
    *University of Liverpool / CERN*
    
    - **Positions held**:  Visiting PhD Candidate at Daresbury Laboratory (Jan 2018 - Apr 2019), CERN Doctoral Student (Apr 2019 - July 2021).\
    - Work concerned with the construction, commissioning and performance measurements of the [Inner Tracking System Upgrade of ALICE](https://cerncourier.com/a/alice-tracks-new-territory/) at the LHC, the largest and most granular Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) tracking detector ever built.
    - Constructed and tested MAPS detector modules and staves in The University of Liverpool and Daresbury Laboratory clean rooms with a 98% yield.
    - Wrote the testing software for the fully integrated tracking system at CERN and verified the performance of its 13 billion channels before installation around the LHC beam pipe.
    - Gathered the first real particle tracks (5 million cosmic muons) and used these to make the first measurement of the detection efficiency, verifying the capability of the final system.
   
Sep 2014 - Sep 2015
:   **Hitch Representative**\
    *Link Community Development*

    - Leader of the Hitch charity scheme in Liverpool, helping 6 teams raise funding for Link Community Development by hitchhiking from Liverpool to Morocco.
