## Professional Experience

---

Jul 2022 - present
:   **Senior Applied Fellow (Detector Operations)**\
    *CERN - Geneva, CH*

    - Coordinated operations for the ATLAS Pixel detector, ensuring maximum up-time and detector safety to support 24/7 LHC data acquisition. 
    - Developed and maintained data acquisition software (C++ / Python) with continuous integration testing, enhancing system responsiveness.
    - Designed and implemented a software package to improve DAQ software flexibility, facilitating faster problem resolution by detector experts.
    - Management and training of 24/7 shift crew • On-call detector expert • Organisation of weekly meetings • Representation of the group in daily ATLAS meetings.
    - Pixel Run Coordinator (Oct 2023 - Oct 2024) during the hadronic collider record breaking year of 2024, and deputy for the six months prior.

Oct 2017 - Jul 2022
:   **Doctoral Researcher**\
    *University of Liverpool / CERN*
    
    - Construction, commissioning, and performance measurements of the ALICE Inner Tracking System Upgrade, the largest Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) tracking detector ever built.
    - Achieved a 98% yield in constructing and testing novel CMOS MAPS detector modules and staves in clean rooms at the University of Liverpool and Daresbury Laboratory.
    - Developed system testing software (Python) for the fully integrated tracking system at CERN, verifying the performance of 13 billion channels.
    - Conducted the first measurement of detection efficiency using 5 million cosmic muon tracks, confirming system capabilities.
