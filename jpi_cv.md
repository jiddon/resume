> Applied physicist working the [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern/) Pixel detector as a CERN Senior Applied Fellow. Over 7 years experience within the field of silicon pixel tracking detectors for HEP experiments, specifically construction, system testing, commissioning and operation.

## Professional Experience

---

Jul 2022 - present
:   **Senior Applied Fellow (Detector Operations)**\
    *[CERN](https://home.cern/) - Geneva, CH*

    - Responsible for the coordination of the operations of the [ATLAS Pixel detector](https://atlas.cern/Discover/Detector/Inner-Detector).
    - On-call detector expert, maximising system up-time and ensuring detector safety to acquire maximum physics data from the 24/7 LHC running schedule.
    - Continuous development of the data acquisition software (C++), with continuous integration testing on a vertical slice of the detector in a test-bench setup. 
    - Designed a software package to increase the flexibility of the DAQ software and increase the speed with which detector experts can react to problems.
    - **Positions held:** Pixel Run Coordinator (Oct 2023 - present), Pixel Deputy Run Coordinator (Apr 2023 - Oct 2023)

Oct 2017 - Jul 2022
:   **PhD in Physics**\
    *University of Liverpool / CERN*
    
    - Construction, commissioning and first performance measurements of the [Inner Tracking System Upgrade of ALICE](https://cerncourier.com/a/alice-tracks-new-territory/) at the LHC, the largest and most granular Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) tracking detector ever built.
    - Constructed and tested novel CMOS MAPS detector modules and staves in The University of Liverpool and Daresbury Laboratory clean rooms with a 98% yield.
    - Wrote the system testing software for the fully integrated tracking system at CERN and verified the performance of its 13 billion channels before installation around the LHC beam pipe.
    - Gathered the first real particle tracks (5 million cosmic muons) and used these to make the first measurement of the detection efficiency, verifying the capability of the final system.
    - **Positions held**:  Visiting PhD Candidate at Daresbury Laboratory (Jan 2018 - Apr 2019), CERN Doctoral Student (Apr 2019 - July 2021).\
