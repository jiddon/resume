Applied physicist working on the operations and readout software development of the [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern/) IBL and pixel detectors as a CERN senior applied fellow. Over 5 years experience in silicon pixel detector construction, commissioning and operation. Earned PhD working on the construction, commissioning and performance measurements of the [ALICE](https://alice-collaboration.web.cern.ch/) ITS2.

## Experience

---

Jul 2022 - present
:   **Senior Applied Fellow**\
    *[CERN](https://home.cern/) - Geneva, CH*

    - Working on the operations and DAQ development of the ATLAS [pixel and IBL detectors](https://atlas.cern/Discover/Detector/Inner-Detector), maximising acquisition of quality data from the 24/7 LHC running schedule by minimising dead time to below 0.1%.
    - Debugging and fixing detector modules with electrical, software, configuration or radiation-damaged-induced problems.
    - Designed a software package to increase the flexibility of the DAQ software and increase the speed with which the on-call shifter can react to problems.
    - Performing hardware interventions and Pixel Run Manager shifts. On-call detector expert.
    - Currently Pixel Deputy Run Coordinator (6 month position).\

Oct 2017 - Jul 2022
:   **PhD in Physics**\
    *University of Liverpool / CERN*

    - Work concerned with the construction, commissioning and performance measurements of the [Inner Tracking System Upgrade of ALICE](https://cerncourier.com/a/alice-tracks-new-territory/) at the LHC, the largest and most granular Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) tracking detector ever built.
    - Employed by both the University of Liverpool (2 years) and CERN (2.5 years).
    - Constructed and tested MAPS detector modules and staves in The University of Liverpool and Daresbury Laboratory clean rooms, with a 98% yield.
    - Wrote the testing software for the fully integrated tracking system at CERN and verified the performance of its 13 billion channels before installation around the LHC beam pipe.
    - Gathered the first real particle tracks (5 million cosmic muons) and used these to make the first measurement of the detection efficiency.

Sep 2014 - Sep 2015
:   **Hitch Representative**\
    *Link Community Development*

    - Leader of the Hitch charity scheme in Liverpool, helping 6 teams raise funding for Link Community Development by hitchhiking from Liverpool to Morocco.
