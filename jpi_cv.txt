Applied physicist working on the operations and readout software
development of the ATLAS IBL and pixel detectors as a CERN senior
applied fellow. Over 5 years experience in silicon pixel detector
construction, commissioning and operation. Earned PhD working on the
construction, commissioning and performance measurements of the ALICE
ITS2.

Professional Experience

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jul 2022 - present

    Senior Applied Fellow (Detector Operations)
    CERN - Geneva, CH

    -   Responsible for operations and DAQ development of the ATLAS
        pixel and IBL detectors, maximising acquisition of quality data
        from the 24/7 LHC running schedule by minimising dead time to
        below 0.1%.
    -   Designed a software package to increase the flexibility of the
        DAQ software and increase the speed with which detector experts
        can react to problems.
    -   Created a tool to monitor detector parameters over time,
        prompting systematic re-tunes and aiding the debugging process
        of problematic modules.
    -   Debugged and fixed detector modules with electrical, software,
        configuration or radiation-damaged-induced problems.
    -   Performed Pixel Run Manager shifts and act as an on-call
        detector expert.
    -   Currently Pixel Deputy Run Coordinator (6 month position).

Oct 2017 - Jul 2022

    PhD in Physics
    University of Liverpool / CERN

    -   Work concerned with the construction, commissioning and
        performance measurements of the Inner Tracking System Upgrade of
        ALICE at the LHC, the largest and most granular Monolithic
        Active Pixel Sensor (MAPS) tracking detector ever built.
    -   Constructed and tested MAPS detector modules and staves in The
        University of Liverpool and Daresbury Laboratory clean rooms
        with a 98% yield.
    -   Wrote the testing software for the fully integrated tracking
        system at CERN and verified the performance of its 13 billion
        channels before installation around the LHC beam pipe.
    -   Gathered the first real particle tracks (5 million cosmic muons)
        and used these to make the first measurement of the detection
        efficiency, verifying the capability of the final system.
    -   Employed by both the University of Liverpool (2 years) and CERN
        (2.5 years).

Sep 2014 - Sep 2015

    Hitch Representative
    Link Community Development

    -   Leader of the Hitch charity scheme in Liverpool, helping 6 teams
        raise funding for Link Community Development by hitchhiking from
        Liverpool to Morocco.
