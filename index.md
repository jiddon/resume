Experience
----------

Since Jul 2022
:   **Senior Applied Fellow at CERN**\
    *Geneva, CH*

    - Working on the operations and DAQ development of the ATLAS pixel and IBL detectors\
    - Created a tool monitor detector parameters over time, prompting systematic re-tunes and aiding the debugging process of problematic modules\
    - Designed a software package to increase the flexibility of the DAQ software and increase the speed with which the on-call shifter can react to problems\
    - Performing hardware interventions and pixel run manager shifts\

Oct 2017 - Jul 2022
:   **PhD in Physics at University of Liverpool / CERN**\
    *Liverpool, UK / Geneva, CH*

    My PhD was on the construction, commissioning and performance measurements of the Inner Tracking System Upgrade of ALICE at the LHC. I was employed by both the University of Liverpool and CERN. The details of my PhD are below:\
